## The Scala Documentation Site

Your main entry point into online documentation on Scala is the official documentation site, [docs.scala-lang.org](http://docs.scala-lang.org/). It contains a growing number of articles, guides and tutorials. The following list highlights some of the most important documents, but the doc site contains much more than that!

## Other resources

COHORTE uses two main existing component models as underlying component-based software frameworks. If you are not yet familiar with iPOJO (Java programming) or iPOPO (Python programming) we encourage you to have a quick look to their respective web sites:

 * [Apache Felix iPOJO](http://felix.apache.org/documentation/subprojects/apache-felix-ipojo.html), a flexible and extensible service component model for Java developed by Cl√©ment Escoffier.
 * [Coderxpress iPOPO](https://ipopo.coderxpress.net), a service-oriented component model (SOCM) framework for Python developed by Thomas Calment.

 You need also to have a clair idea about the Service-Oriented Computing in general and OSGi specifications in particular.

 * [Service-Oriented Architecture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture): "Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a software design and software architecture design pattern based on distinct pieces of software providing application functionality as services to other applications. This is known as service-orientation. It is independent of any vendor, product or technology." (from Wikipedia)
 * [OSGi Specification](http://osgi.org): "OSGi technology is a set of specifications that defines a dynamic component system for Java. These specifications reduce software complexity by providing a modular architecture for large-scale distributed systems as well as small, embedded applications." (from OSGi Fondation website)
