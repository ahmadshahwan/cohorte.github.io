## Spellchecker tutorial

Intended for new COHORTE users, this tutorial provides step-by-step introduction to COHORTE, starting with a simple application using Python or Java programming language. All the resulting code can be found in [spellchecker-demo.zip](#) file, however we encourage you to follow the different steps of this tutorial to build your own fresh COHORTE application.

The goal of this first tutorial is to highlight the Service-oriented Component-based approach to construct modular and dynamic software applications. Other features of COHORTE <a href="../../what-is-cohorte">listed here</a>, are explored and explained in <a href="../">other tutorials</a>.

To get started, choose first your preferend programming language:

      href="./java.html">Java</a>
</div>

<div class="note">
