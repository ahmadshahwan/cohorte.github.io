The latest development version of Cohorte (1.0.1.dev) has a support for deploying any Cohorte Node on IBM Bluemix Paas (Platform-As-A-Service). 

As IBM Bluemix is based on [Cloud Foundry](http://cloudfoundry.org), you need to have CloudFoundry CLI installed on your machine to be able to deploy your Cohorte Node to the Cloud using the developed [cohorte-buildpack](https://github.com/cohorte/cohorte-buildpack) buildpack. 

For now, only Cohorte Python Runtime is supported. Other runtimes buildpacks are under development.
